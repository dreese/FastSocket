FastSocket
===============

Description
---------------

A high-throughput, synchronous Objective-C wrapper around BSD sockets for iOS and macOS.
Send and receive raw bytes over a socket as fast as possible. Includes methods
for transferring files while optionally computing a checksum for verification.
Swift compatible.

Use this class if fast network communication is what you need. If you want to
do something else while your network operations finish, then an asynchronous
API might be better.

For more information, please visit the [project homepage](http://github.com/dreese/FastSocket).
FastSocket is also available as a [CocoaPod](http://cocoapods.org/?q=fastsocket).

Download
---------------

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/dreese/FastSocket/releases) of FastSocket or try the [nightly version](https://github.com/dreese/FastSocket/archive/master.zip).

Examples
---------------

Create and connect a client socket.

```objc
FastSocket *client = [[FastSocket alloc] initWithHost:@"localhost" andPort:@"34567"];
[client connect];
```

Send a file.

```objc
long sent = [client sendFile:@"/tmp/filetosend.txt"];
```

Receive a file of a given length.

```objc
long received = [client receiveFile:@"/tmp/newlyreceivedfile.txt" length:1024];
```

Send a string.

```objc
NSData *data = [@"test" dataUsingEncoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
long count = [client sendBytes:[data bytes] count:[data length]];
```

Receive a string.

```objc
char bytes[expectedLength];
[client receiveBytes:bytes count:expectedLength];
NSString *received = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:bytes length:expectedLength encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
```

Send raw bytes.

```objc
char data[] = {42};
long sent = [client sendBytes:data count:1];
```

Receive available raw bytes up to the given limit.

```objc
char data[42];
long received = [client receiveBytes:data limit:42];
```

Receive the exact number of raw bytes given.

```objc
char data[1000];
long received = [client receiveBytes:data count:1000];
```

Close the connection.

```objc
[client close];
```

Please check out the unit tests for more examples of how to use these classes.
